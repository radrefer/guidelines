# ☢️ RadRefer
The free open source alternative to the Royal College of Radiologists iRefer medical imaging guidelines system. RadRefer offers both free and open public browser based access and a totally open API for developers to easily integrate these guidelines into their own applications or websites.

## Why we did this
We believe that medical information that benefits patients and the doctors helping those patients should be free and open access. Hiding information behind paywalls simply inhibits time critical access and restricts education of referrers with a net reduction in quality of care and learning.

The overall effect of closed source referral guidelines is detrimental to radiology as a profession. We did not support the Royal College of Radiologists' decision to keep iRefer as a closed source resource licensed exclusively to a single company for use in clinical decision support systems.

## Isn't it a mammoth task
It is indeed a mammoth task to keep contemporary referral guidelines for every corner of Radiology and it will undoubtedly take a long time to reach the kind of traction we hope for.

It is our hope that other radiologists will appreciate the desperate need for readily accessible open access guidelines to facilitate the best use of radiology services - in the true original spirit of iRefer "Making the best use of Radiology'
